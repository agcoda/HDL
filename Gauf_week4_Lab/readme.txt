Both modules for q2 and q3 are in "week4_assign.sv"
partial_Decoder for the first system
counterFSM for the second system

test benches for each module are separated as p1 and p2.

The pdfs contain annotated captures of the simulation using ModelSIM

First time learning any HDLs so didn't get to the assert and files from the book. I'll try it for next week.
